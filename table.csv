Chem #91 is thought to be an offshoot of the original Chemdog strain, and the numerical addition of “91” is believed to reference the year the strain first came into existence.
Some growers believe Chem 91 to be a cross between Chemdog and Skunk, which may explain its particularly pungent aroma. In true family spirit, this hybrid has a very strong diesel smell with a piney-lemon aftertaste.

Its super strong skunky smell may border on unappetizing, but its large, hairy buds make up for it with equally potent effects. Sativa-dominant, this strain will free your mind and may verge into the psychedelic for some. A clone-only plant, true connoisseurs wonder if the original can still be found.

Ushered in by a sweet herbal aroma, Jamaican Lion induces mild psychoactivity that carries through despite its low THC content. Sensory perception sharpens as bad moods dull in clear-headed sensations that can be described as simultaneously uplifting and calming. Few strains compare to Jamaican Lion as it eases pain, anxiety, and inflammation without intoxication or mental cloudiness. Its CBD content is highest around week 9 of flowering, but if you’re looking for more of a 1:1 ratio of CBD and THC, Shadrock recommends harvesting at week 8 instead.

The strain quickly made its way to the Northern California coastline where the dense buds now bloom. Truth Serum carries a sweet tropical aroma and is frosted with a thick coat of trichomes.

As the plant migrated to North America the growers kept the Cough surname, interchanging the region or city it represented. Starting with Colorado Cough, the genetics spread northwest to include Seattle Cough as well as Canadian Cough.
Seattle Cough (no relation to Strawberry Cough) carries a pungent mix of pine and citrus flavors. The aroma of fresh grapefruit serves as a precursor to the uplifting sativa effects, sparking creativity and dreamy euphoria.

The strain’s roots can be traced back to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. 

In the late 1970s, the Soviet Union experimented with high-THC cannabis extracts for their own “MK Ultra”-type program, but subsequently abandoned the efforts, much like Americans did with the US strain G-13. This high-grade, high-THC, indica-hybrid cultivar escaped from a Russian research lab and made its way to Canada via seeds carried by a defector. Later, the CIA surreptitiously sold what became Purple Palm Tree Delight cannabis as part of a domestic, anti-communist operation. Underground retail networks in the US in the ‘80s gave the cultivar a variety of colorful names—Canadian P, B.C.P, “the P”—but the moniker ""Purple Palm Tree Delight"" proved the most catchy when it appeared in the titular rap song by Run DMC, for which the group went triple-platinum.

Purple Palm Tree Delight results in full body and mind relaxation, an experience you truly must try before you deny. Medical marijuana patients choose Purple Palm Tree Delight to help relieve symptoms associated with running up that road, running up that hill, running from a Demogorgon, or managing the kind of PTSD only the Upside Down can create. Pick up some Purple Palm Tree Delight weed for those nights where you’re settling in on the couch to binge-watch your favorite ‘80s-set supernatural drama while polishing off some pineapple pizza.

(A note from Leafly: No, this strain does not actually exist yet, but if you want to pick up something similar that doesn't require time travel and a bowl cut, we recommend Granddaddy Purple, Sunset Sherbet, Purple Punch, Forbidden Fruit, or Grape Ape. Or browse our collection of over 6,000 strains to discover a new strain or Eleven to buy near you.)",,,,

The strain’s roots can be traced back to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. 

In the late 1970s, the Soviet Union experimented with high-THC cannabis extracts for their own “MK Ultra”-type program, but subsequently abandoned the efforts, much like Americans did with the US strain G-13. This high-grade, high-THC, indica-hybrid cultivar escaped from a Russian research lab and made its way to Canada via seeds carried by a defector. Later, the CIA surreptitiously sold what became Purple Palm Tree Delight cannabis as part of a domestic, anti-communist operation. Underground retail networks in the US in the ‘80s gave the cultivar a variety of colorful names—Canadian P, B.C.P, “the P”—but the moniker ""Purple Palm Tree Delight"" proved the most catchy when it appeared in the titular rap song by Run DMC, for which the group went triple-platinum.

Purple Palm Tree Delight results in full body and mind relaxation, an experience you truly must try before you deny. Medical marijuana patients choose Purple Palm Tree Delight to help relieve symptoms associated with running up that road, running up that hill, running from a Demogorgon, or managing the kind of PTSD only the Upside Down can create. Pick up some Purple Palm Tree Delight weed for those nights where you’re settling in on the couch to binge-watch your favorite ‘80s-set supernatural drama while polishing off some pineapple pizza.

(A note from Leafly: No, this strain does not actually exist yet, but if you want to pick up something similar that doesn't require time travel and a bowl cut, we recommend Granddaddy Purple, Sunset Sherbet, Purple Punch, Forbidden Fruit, or Grape Ape.
